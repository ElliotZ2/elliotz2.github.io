        You can use this website to choose 5 different colors and see how good they would look like when used together.
        For example, you can try using this to find nice color themes for your website CSS or for any form of art that involves choosing colors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Start by Clicking on a color input tile under the "color" table column and choose a new color.
        Then you can see the RGB and hexadecimal values of each color as you change them to make it easier to actually use those colors.
        If you're finished selecting your colors, why not test them out on the "draw" page where you can use your colors to create some basic pixel art.
        Alternatively, you can check out the gallery to see how your colors look like next to each other after they have been applied as a filter to random images.

<!--
    I wanted to create a website to help pick colors because choosing colors for your website is an small problem that everyone has to face.
    This website also doesn't just have to be for choosing website colors since it can be used for other types of design.
    For basic functionality, I used a color type input to allow the user to choose 5 different colors.
    I then made use of localstorage and javascript to transfer these same colors across multiple pages.
    I also had to use javascript to change the information on the table whenever a colorinput color was changed

    navbar: I created a navbar that's the same for every page that shows the selected colors from the color inputs of the home page

    draw: I found online that you can emulate a drawing canvas with a bunch of small "pixels" on a grid; using javascript, i made it so
    each pixel would change its background color to the selected color whenever the mousedown event happens on it

    gallery: for the gallery, i just used a random image generator and then overlayed a semi-transparent div with colors as a filter

    more: I wanted this website to also contain some basic information about colors in order to help the user make educated choices on choosing colors
    So I included some basic facts about colors like their classification, then I included some factors that may influence color decisions such as
    color blindness, complementary colors, and trademarked colors
